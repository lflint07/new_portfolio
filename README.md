# new_portfolio
This is an updated version or 2.0 of my original online portfolio.

# Description

This portfolio is my attempt to improve upon the previous iteration of my portfolio to better emphasize my current skills with the portfolio itself as well as showcase newer work that I've created, both personally and professionally.

My plan is to routinely update and upgrade this site as it is a live example of the work I continue to accomplish.

I created this page using HTML, Javascript and the Bulma CSS framework. I am currently not familiar with SASS therefore I had to manipulate the CSS inline in the HTML to work correctly with the Bulma configuration.
